RESEARCH PAPER: Advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Abstract

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing large language models with external knowledge. This paper presents
a comprehensive analysis of RAG architectures and their applications.

Introduction

Traditional language models are limited by their training data cutoff and
inability to access real-time information. RAG addresses these limitations
by combining retrieval systems with generative models.

Methodology

We evaluated 5 different RAG architectures across 3 benchmark datasets:
1. Naive RAG: Simple retrieval + generation
2. Advanced RAG: With query rewriting and re-ranking
3. Modular RAG: Specialized retrievers for different content types
4. Agentic RAG: Autonomous decision-making for retrieval
5. Self-RAG: Self-reflection and critique mechanisms

Results

Our experiments show that Agentic RAG achieves:
- 23% improvement in answer accuracy over naive RAG
- 35% reduction in hallucination rate
- 2.1x faster response time with caching

Key findings:
- Query rewriting improves retrieval precision by 18%
- Hybrid search (dense + sparse) outperforms single method by 15%
- Self-reflection reduces factual errors by 40%

Conclusion

Agentic RAG represents the next evolution in knowledge-augmented AI systems,
providing more accurate, reliable, and contextually relevant responses.
