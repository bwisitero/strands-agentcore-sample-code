Setup Instructions:

1. Configure AWS credentials:
   - Set up ~/.aws/credentials with your AWS access key
   - Or set environment variables:
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
     export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

2. Enable Claude 3 in Bedrock:
   - Go to AWS Console > Bedrock > Model access
   - Request access to "Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet"
   - Wait for approval (usually instant)

3. Install optional dependencies:
   uv add pillow  # For creating test images

4. Run the demo:
   uv run python 19_image_analysis.py

5. Use with your own images:
   # Place images in the same directory, or provide full path
   response = image_agent("Analyze my_photo.jpg")

Example Questions to Ask:
- "Describe this image in detail"
- "What text can you see in this image?"
- "What objects are present in this image?"
- "What is the mood or atmosphere of this scene?"
- "Identify the main colors in this image"
- "What activities are happening in this image?"

Supported Image Formats:
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)

Image Size Limits:
- Max file size: ~5MB (Bedrock limit)
- Recommended: Resize large images before analysis

Production Enhancements:
- Add image preprocessing (resize, optimize)
- Implement caching for repeated analyses
- Add batch processing for multiple images
- Handle image URLs (download and analyze)
- Add confidence scores for detections
- Implement retry logic for API calls
- Add cost tracking and monitoring
- Support video frame extraction

Alternative Vision Models:
- Claude 3 Opus (more capable, slower)
- Claude 3 Haiku (faster, less expensive)
- Google Gemini Pro Vision

üñºÔ∏è  Image Analysis with AWS Bedrock Claude
======================================================================

No images found in current directory.
Creating a sample image for demonstration...

I'll create a sample image first and then analyze it for you.
Tool #1: create_sample_image
Now let me analyze the sample image that was created:
Tool #2: analyze_image_with_claude
Perfect! I've created and analyzed a sample image. Here's what the analysis revealed:

**Sample Image Analysis:**

The created sample image is a simple test image containing:

- **Layout**: Clean, minimalist design on a white background
- **Shapes**: Two geometric elements positioned side by side
  - **Left**: A blue rectangle 
  - **Right**: A red oval/ellipse
- **Text**: "Test Image" label appears below the shapes
- **Purpose**: This appears to be a basic test or reference image, commonly used for demonstration purposes

The image demonstrates basic geometric shapes and colors, making it ideal for testing image analysis capabilities. It's a straightforward design that clearly shows how the vision model can identify shapes, colors, positioning, and text elements within an image.

Would you like me to analyze a different image or ask any specific questions about this sample image?Perfect! I've created and analyzed a sample image. Here's what the analysis revealed:
